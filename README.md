# ColorfulFolders
ColorfulFolders is a very simple Unity utility to set custom colors for Project window folders.

## Usage

Crate scriptable objects of type FolderColorCollection (RMB > Create > ColorfulFolders > FolderColorCollection).

Add an entry to its Data member.

Set Path property to full path of the folder to color (e.g. Assets/Scripts).

Set Color property to desired color. As this solution simply draws colored rectangle over the item the color should probably be transparent.

## Example

![Alt text](config.png?raw=true "FolderColorCollection")

![Alt text](result1.png?raw=true "Result")

![Alt text](result2.png?raw=true "Result")
